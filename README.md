- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    - Testing early and often ensures that the software performes to the required functionality: in terms of both restrictions and expected behavior.
    - Automated testing and security tools can assist in providing vulnerability reports and broad testing coverage: ensuring the security of the entirety of the project.
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    - Both positive and negative testing should be performed to ensure the programs' success in expected behavior. Unexepected behavior, particularly with the user experience, needs to be anticipated and tested for. This pertains to results that are implied or that come out of left field. 
- How do I approach designing software?
    - Customer and software requirements largely determine both the architecture and design or a software problem. Understanding how parts of a program are intended to be used informs the decision on aspects of the software. Examples of this are data structures chosen for their in build methods and time complexity. Another example would be dissalowing certain user inputs in terms of content type. This aspect overlaps with areas of concern relating to security, where input validation and proper sanitizing crucial to software design.
